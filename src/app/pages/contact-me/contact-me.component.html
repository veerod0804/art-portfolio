        <h1>About the Artist</h1>
        <h2>I am a mixed media artist in the Saint Louis area. I am most active creating three dimensional art forms. My portfolio consists of Cereamics, Drawings, Glassblowing, Printmaking, and Sculpture. I get lost in the process of creating and it has become an outlet for anxiety relief. </h2>
