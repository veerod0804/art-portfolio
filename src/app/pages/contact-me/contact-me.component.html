        <h1>About the Artist</h1>
        <h2>I am a mixed media artist in the Saint Louis area. I am most passionate about creating three dimensional art forms. My portfolio consists of Ceramics, Drawings, Glassblowing, Printmaking, and Sculpture. I get lost in the process of creating. Art has become an outlet for handling anxiety and depression. </h2>
